What Is Javascript? 
    -language used to add a program to web pages
    -makes modern  web applications possible
    -used to provide various forms of interactivity and cleverness
    -Javascriptis very liberal in what it allows
Typograpahic conventions 
    - text written in monospaced font will represent elements of programs
    -sometimes output is shown with two slashes and an arrow and the output 
    after that 
Chapter 1(Values, Types, and Operators)
    -there is only data in the computer world
    -data is stored as sequences of bits 
    -Bits- are two values things(0s and 1s)
    Values  
        -in  a computer there are many bits and to not get lost in it, they are
        seperated into chunks called values that represent info.
        -all values are made of bits but have different roles ex. numbers,
        texts, or functions etc...
        -to create a value you just give it a name
    Numbers
        - are numeric values(obviously)
        -for big numbers you can use scientific notation-add and e with the exponent number after it 
        -supports order of opperations(PEMDAS); (+,-,*,/)
        - (%) used to represent the remainder operation ; operators precedence same as 
        multiplication and division 
    Special Numbers
        - 3 values that are numbers but dont behave like normal numbers:
        1&2.Infinity and -Infinity (positive and negative infinities)
        3.NaN= "not a number"-get this when the operations dont yeild a meaningful result
    Strings
        -represents text
        -written by enclosing the text in quotes
        -could use single or double quotes but need to be consistent 
        -when a \ is used inside a quoted text means the character after it has a special meaning->called 
        escaping the mafia 
        -(\n) interpreted as a new line
        -(\t) is intrepreted as a a tab 
        - if two \\ follow eachother they collapse on eachother and only one is left 
        in the resulting string
        -strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted but (+) can combine two strings together
        -backtick `` quoted strings are usually called template literals and can embed other values 
    Unary Operators 
        -typeof operator names the type of the value you give it 
        -use console.log to indicate you want something shown 
        -operators that tuse two values are called binary operators and those that take one are unary operators
        -(-) operator can e binary and unary 
    Boolean Values
        -
