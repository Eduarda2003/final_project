My Notes
Chapter 2(Variables and Simple Data Types)
    -when you create a variable and assign it a value it associates that value eiththat word
    -you can change variable values and Python will keep track of the current value
    Rules about creating variables:
        - Only letters, numbers,and underscores
        -cannot start with a number
        -spaces not allowed
        -don't use python key words
        -spelling has to be consistent not correct but consistent
    Strings(data type):
        -series of charatcers inside of quotes
        -methods are followed by ()
        -to call a method, a dot is put after the variable
    Combining Strings or Concatenating Strings
        -python uses the + symbol to combine strings (called Concatenating)
        -you can store an entire composed message in a variable
        -title() method is used to format a name properly 
    Adding whitespace to strings with tabs or newlines
        -whitespace: nonprinting characters ex. spaces,tabs,and end of line 
        symbols- meant to help organize output to make it easier to read
        -to tab text use "\
        -to add a new line in a string use \n 
        -to start a newline with a tab use \n\t 
    Stripping whitespace
        -extra whitespace is confusing
        -extra space in strings could differenciate them and cause errors
        -important cause many times you would want to check if strings are the same
        -use rstrip() method to check for whitespace at the right end of a string
        -the method removes whitespace temporarily and if you check the value of the variable again 
        then it would go back with whitespace---to remove permanently you must store the new value in the variable
        -you can also use lstrip() to remove whitespace from the left or strip() to remove whitesapce from both sides
        -in real world, the strip functions are used to clean up user input before being stored
    Avoiding Syntax errors
        -avoid using apostrophys inside single quotes...instead use double quotes with apostrophys inside so 
        that python understands when a string starts and ends, therefore avoiding syntax errors
Numbers
    Integers
        - you can add(+), subract(-), multiply(*) and divide(/)
        -Python uses ** to represent exponents
        -suports order of opperations (PEMDAS)- so you can use multiple applications in one expression 
        -spacing has no effect on how Python evaluates the expression
    Floats
        - any number with a decimal point
        -sometimes you can get alot of decimal places but its not a big deal just python
        trying to give you a precise answer
    Avoiding Type Errors with the str() function
        - typeError means python cant recognize the information 
        -when you write integers within strings you must specify that you want the integer to be interpreted as 
        a string of characters--do this by wrapping the variable in the str()function
Comments 
    -helpful for you to understand what your code is doing as it gets more complicated
    -# indic



    to make others available to github
    1st use git clone + url  to clone the project 
    to push a file 
        - check status for untrackked files-- git status
        - then git add . to add all files or git add + name of file
        -check status again to make sure its tracked
        -then commit with git  commit -m "message"
        -lastly git push origin master 
    for others to pull anything new from the branch(updates;new files)--use git pull origin master 
    -can't push anything until i pull everything from the master branch
